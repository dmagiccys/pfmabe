        data structure and how it came to be you can read the <a
          href="PFM.html">PFM. html</a> file in this same directory.
        This document is for programmers or system administrators who
        want to build, and possibly modify, the Area-Based Editor (ABE)
        on their own systems.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-right: 0.49in;"
      align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">First, I need to explain to all of
        the hotshot programmers out there that I am self-taught. I
        taught myself Fortran IV in 1978 so that I wouldn't have to
        spend the rest of my life typing navigation fixes onto IBM punch
        cards (thrill a minute). In 1989 I taught myself C because I
        liked the idea of memory allocation. I did finally take a course
        in C so I could figure out why I was doing what I was doing. ABE
        was originally written in C using Motif graphics. What a
        nightmare. In 2003, in my copious spare time, I started working
        on an open source audio mastering program called <a
          href="http://jamin.sourceforge.net">JAMin</a>. I handled the
        graphics code. This got me familiar with GTK and GLADE. As
        primitive as GTK is, I could see that it was a huge leap forward
        over Motif. I wasn't thrilled with using a GUI builder though so
        I did a little checking around and discovered Qt. After looking
        at the documentation, I was sold. There was only one problem.
        You guessed it, I had to teach myself C++. In early 2005 I
        ported the original ABE from C/Motif to C++/Qt. As I said
        before, I don't like GUI builders, so I didn't use QDesigner.
        Good thing too because the port from Qt3 to Qt4 in 2007 would
        have killed me. In late 2008&nbsp; I taught myself OpenGL so
        that I could build the 3D surface viewers and point cloud
        editors.&nbsp; <br>
      </font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-right: 0.49in;"
      align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">What's all this leading to? Well,
        when you look at my C++ code you'll see that it looks a lot like
        C. I rarely use <i>new</i>. Instead I use <i>malloc</i>, <i>calloc</i>,
        and <i>realloc</i>. I know that <i>assert</i> is some kind of
        error checking thing but I have no idea how it works. I don't
        use <i>vectors</i> or other C++ constructs. You get the
        picture? Most of what I know about C++ I got from the Qt example
        programs (excellent stuff by the way). On the other hand, I have
        been told that I comment too much (is that an oxymoron?). My IDE
        of choice is Xemacs. I keep my code as clean and easy to read as
        possible. Also, because the Naval Oceanographic Office (my
        employer) handles a huge amount of data my primary objective is
        speed. Esthetics aren't that important.&nbsp; Most of my library
        code is pure C.&nbsp; I like to keep APIs low-level.&nbsp;
        You'll also note that I use <span style="font-style: italic;">-ansi</span>
        and <span style="font-style: italic;">-Wall</span> on all of my
        compiles.<br>
      </font></p>

      align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In addition to my use of Xemacs and
        my archaic, C code-like C++, I haven't used the standard&nbsp;<span

        technique.&nbsp; I can't help it, I'm lazy (plus I really only
        have to support two platforms).&nbsp; Instead I've built scripts
        in the top level directory and each of the program
        directories.&nbsp; As you'll discover shortly, the scripts are
        all named <span style="font-style: italic;">mk</span>.&nbsp;
        For the C++ code they run Qt's <span style="font-style:

        you also need MinGW64.&nbsp; There are two MinGW installers
        included with PFM_ABE.&nbsp; They are MinGW-20100831-Setup.exe
        and MinGW64-20100831-Setup.exe for 32 bit and 64 bit
        respectively.&nbsp; These two installers were built from a

        want the Documentation_MMDDYY.tgz file even though it's not

        contains 14 Free Open-Source Software packages that we need to

        BEECRYPT, GDAL, HDF5, JPEG, LEASTSQUARES, LIBLAS, MESCHACH,

        Note that the MMDDYY in the tar file names is the month, day,
        and year of the last update.&nbsp; Since the documentation and
        the FOSS files are really large (approximately 100MB and 200MB
        respectively) you probably only want to download new versions if

          a bunch of software built and you have no idea how to get your
          data into the programs. If you happen to use Generic Sensor
          Format (GSF), Optech's Hydrographic Output Format (HOF) or
          Topographic Output Format (TOF), or AHAB's Generic Binary
          Format (BIN) you're in good shape. If you have something else
          you've got a little bit of work ahead of you.<br>
        </font></font></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-right: 0.49in;"
      align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3"><font size="3">Since most of the
          software included in PFM_ABE is based on the Pure File Magic
          (PFM) data structure you're going to have to get your data
          into that form. PFM was designed to allow you to read your
          data into a PFM structure, edit the data in the structure, and
          then save those changes back to your original input file. In
          order to do this there are some requirements for your data
          format. First, the data must be addressable by record and,
          optionally, sub-record (you can think of this as ping and beam
          for multibeam systems or shot and return for lidar systems).
          For GSF, because it uses variable record lengths, we had to
          index the data files. This is handled transparently by the GSF
          library. For HOF, TOF, and BIN it was much simpler because the
          records are fixed length. The second requirement is that you
          have to be able to store and retrieve validity information for
          each record/sub-record. This can be as simple as having a
          single bit or character that indicates that a
          record/sub-record is valid or invalid or it can be more
          complex (like beam status in GSF). There are, at present, 18
          validity bits in use in PFM (five are user defined). The third
          requirement is very important - you have to have position
          information. For PFM_ABE the positions are geographic. While
          PFM will support projected data, PFM_ABE does not (UTM is for
          people who need to draw lines on paper ;-)&nbsp; If you have
          no need to save your edits back to your input files the
          requirements get a bit simpler in that you do not have to have
          an ability to store validity.<br>
          <br>
          In order to get your data into PFM you will need to modify a
          few files in the pfmLoad program (and pfmLoader if you want to
          run from the command line) and also a couple of files in the
          PFM library. In pfmLoad the first file to be modified is
          load_file.cpp. You should be able to cut and paste one of the
          check_XXX_file and load_XXX_file sections and just replace XXX
          with your data type. An example of a very simple data type is
          HOF so take a look at check_hof_file and load_hof_file. GSF is
          quite a bit more complicated and uses yet another function to
          break out separate beams from each ping. In either case it's
          not rocket science. After making your check/load functions you
          need to add them to pfmLoad.cpp. It's very easy to find where
          they go in the code. Just cut and paste another few lines in
          each section. The last file you need to change in pfmLoad is
          get_file_type.cpp. This function determines file type based on
          file extension or file header. This leads us to yet another
          problem - if you are defining a new data type you need to make
          sure that PFM understands what it is. To do this you will need
          to modify pfm.h and pfm_io.c in the pfm_lib_5 directory (you
          should probably make the same changes in pfm_lib_6 just in
          case we ever get our act together and move forward). You will
          need to add a data type in the <b>Data types</b> section of
          pfm.h. Please try to define in the comments how you are
          loading the data for the data type. Take a look at
          PFM_SHOALS_TOF_DATA for an example. Data type numbers should
          be coordinated with me since we don't want collisions (email <a
            href="mailto:jan.depner@navy.mil">jan.depner@navy.mil</a> or
        </font></font><font size="3"><font size="3"><a
            href="mailto:eviltwin69@cableone.net">eviltwin69@cableone.net</a></font></font><font
        size="3"><font size="3">) . After adding the data type you need
          to modify pfm_io.c to recognize that data type. There is only
          one place that it needs to be set and that is in the
          open_pfm_file function. It should be intuitively obvious to
          the most casual observer ;-)<br>
          <br>
          After making your changes to pfmLoad and pfm_lib_5 just cd to
          the new_edit-6.3.1 directory and issue the same ./mk command
          that you used to build it the first time. If we hadn't changed
          the library you could have issued the same ./mk command in the
          pfmLoad directory and it would have built just that program.<br>
