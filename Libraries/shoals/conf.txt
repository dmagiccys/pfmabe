Jan,
 
Here it is....
 
As you noticed, there are a lot of them.  They are as 
follows (all from outputs):
 
    ab_dep_conf        -This is a confidence for the main depth 
        (reported_depth and tide_cor_depth).  It is on a scale of 1 
        to 99.  The cutoff for producing a depth is 50.  Anything 
        lower will not have a depth (-998 which is for no depth).  
        In theory, the value is supposed to be one centimeter of 
        uncertainty for each point in the confidence.  I believe 
        that they keep (unload) all data with a value of 70 or 
        better in the field.

    sec_ab_dep_conf    -Same as above but is for the second depth.

    otf_abd_conf       -As above but for when in "OTF" mode.  This
        is when they have used OTF GPS data for processing instead 
        of the standard DGPS.

    otf_sec_abd_conf   -As above but for the second OTF depth
 
    depth_conf         -This is a coded depth confidence.  I don't
        think you want to get into this one.  

    sec_depth_conf     -As above but for the second depth

Dave, 

    Can you give me a run down on the confidence values in the output file? 


Jan
