/****************************************  IMPORTANT NOTE  **********************************

    Comments in this file that start with / * ! are being used by Doxygen to document the
    software.  Dashes in these comment blocks are used to create bullet lists.  The lack of
    blank lines after a block of dash preceeded comments means that the next block of dash
    preceeded comments is a new, indented bullet list.  I've tried to keep the Doxygen
    formatting to a minimum but there are some other items (like <br> and <pre>) that need
    to be left alone.  If you see a comment that starts with / * ! and there is something
    that looks a bit weird it is probably due to some arcane Doxygen syntax.  Be very
    careful modifying blocks of Doxygen comments.

  - Module Name:        invgp

  - Programmer:         Unknown

  - Date Written:       When dinosaurs roamed the earth.

  - Modified:           Jan C. Depner, converted to C and changed the
                        arguments to degrees instead of radians.

  - Date:               September, 1992

  - Modified:           Jan C. Depner, changed name to make PFM library
                        standalone.

  - Date:               February, 2002

  - Purpose:            Given the semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, and
                        two geographic positions this routine will compute
                        the distance between the two gp's and the azimuth
                        (clockwise from north) from the first gp to the
                        second gp.

  - Inputs:
                        - a0                  =   semi-major axis in meters
                        - b0                  =   semi-minor axis in meters
                        - rlat1               =   start latitude in degrees
                        - rlon1               =   start longitude in degrees
                        - rlat2               =   end latitude in degrees
                        - rlon2               =   end longitude in degrees
                        - dist                =   distance in meters
                        - az                  =   azimuth in degrees
