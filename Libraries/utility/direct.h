/****************************************  IMPORTANT NOTE  **********************************

    Comments in this file that start with / * ! are being used by Doxygen to document the
    software.  Dashes in these comment blocks are used to create bullet lists.  The lack of
    blank lines after a block of dash preceeded comments means that the next block of dash
    preceeded comments is a new, indented bullet list.  I've tried to keep the Doxygen
    formatting to a minimum but there are some other items (like <br> and <pre>) that need
    to be left alone.  If you see a comment that starts with / * ! and there is something
    that looks a bit weird it is probably due to some arcane Doxygen syntax.  Be very
    careful modifying blocks of Doxygen comments.
