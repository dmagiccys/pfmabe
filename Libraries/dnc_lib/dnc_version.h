    First version.


    Version 1.01
    04/07/08
    Jan C. Depner

    Added dnc.h to alleviate having to add all of the single include files in applications.


    Version 1.02
    06/03/08
    Jan C. Depner

    More sanity checking in edge.c


    Version 1.03
    07/28/08

    Yet more sanity checking in edge.c.  Apparently we can have a variable index record with no records.

    Jan C. Depner

    Increased value of MAX_DNC_TABLES from 256 to 512 in table_header.h.
